# Happy Prime Starter Theme

## Initial theme setup

A handful of terms should be replaced throughout the theme to make it specific for the project.

1. Search and replace `translation-slug` with a more appropriate translation slug.
2. Search and replace `$theme_prefix_` with a more appropriate prefix for use with global variables.
3. Search and replace `ThemeMainNamespace` with a more appropriate namespace.
4. Search and replace `themeprefix` with a more appropriate prefix for enqueueing styles and applying filters.

## Build tools and process

* Run `npm install` within the theme directory.
* Run `npm run build` to lint and build CSS.
